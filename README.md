# project_1_group_06
## Data Science Bootcamp Project 6
## This project talks about of Vehicle Emissions

We explored data analysis of Vehicle CO2 Emissions, that is broken down into the following tasks:
1.	 Cleaning Data
2.	Visualizations of data
3.	Analysis and conclusion including Statistical analysis

## Resources:

We used secondary data from Kaggle called 'Vehicle Emissions Data Set'.  The base date has information about 6,756 records
Methods 
Programming language: Python with libraries as panda, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, Scipy, sklearn.

## Submission:

### All below files are under the submission folder.
1.	Dataset is in rescources folder in 'uk_gov_data_sparse_preproc.csv'.
2.	'proposal.pdf' contains our project proposal.
3.	'vehicle_emissions_EDA_analysis.ipynb' contains our python code.
4.  'presentation.pdf' contains our slideshow presentation
5.  'writeup.pdf' contains our detailed writeup to go along with our presentation.


Finally, the repository contains a folder for each member of the team.
